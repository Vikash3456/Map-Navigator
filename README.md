Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that efficiently determines the shortest path between two nodes in a graph with non-negative edge path costs. It constructs a shortest path tree (SPT) with the source node as the root, where each node in the tree represents the shortest path from the source node to that particular node.
